# Issues

### Unexpected behaviour: In visual mode (any) <code>`\<S-,\></code> does not take you to the start of the last selection
1.  Go to any visual mode
2.  Go back to normal mode
3.  Scroll down to another location
4.  Enter a visual mode and press <code>`\<S-,\></code> (Ideally selection expands to start of last selection)
